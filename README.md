## Algorithms

The following table illustrates the inplemented algorithms:

| Abbreviation | Algorithm |
| ------ | ------ |
| op | The OnePass algorithm |
| mp | The MultiPass algorithm |
| opplus | The OnePass+ performance-oriented heuristic algorithm |
| svp | The SVP+ performance-oriented heuristic algorithm |
| esx | The ESX performance-oriented heuristic algorithm |
| svpc | The SVP-C completeness-oriented heuristic algorithm |
| esx-c | The ESX-C completeness-oriented heuristic algorithm |

## Tests

In order to run the program and test the algorithms you must first compile the source code. Before compliling, change the compiler the the paths in the Makefile. Then, in order to compile, simply

```sh
$ make
```

Then, in order to run the run.exec with the sample file:

```sh
$ ./run.exec -f sample/sample.gr -k [PATHS] -s [THRESHOLD] -S [SRC] -T [TRG] -a [ALGORITHM]
```
The following table shows the possible values for each parameter.

| Command | Description | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PATHS | The number of requested result paths k | [0,+inf] |
| THRESHOLD | Similarity threshold θ | [0,1] |
| SRC | The source query node | [0,NUM_NODES] |
| TRG | The target query node | [0,NUM_NODES] |
| ALGORITHM | The selected algorithm | op\|mp\|opplus\|svpplus\|esx |
